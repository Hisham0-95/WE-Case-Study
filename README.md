# Overcoming Core Technical Challenges
My successful completion of the assessment required overcoming several significant obstacles:

**1. Large-Scale Data Handling**

**The Challenge**: The project involved my first exposure to true Big Data—nine tables, including four fact tables with millions of rows—a scale common in telecom environments.

**The Achievement**: I successfully managed the dataset and navigated the initial performance hurdles. This experience cemented my confidence in my ability to handle, process, and analyze enterprise-level data volumes efficiently.

**2. Data Contextualization Without Metadata**

**The Challenge:** The data lacked crucial metadata, making the interpretation of columns complex and hindering initial cleaning efforts.

**The Achievement:** I proactively utilized industry research, Google, and AI tools to rapidly build a strong contextual understanding of standard telecom data structures and metrics. This quick adaptation was key to successfully cleaning the data and generating relevant insights.

**3. Mastering Advanced DAX Measures**

**The Challenge:** The assessment demanded highly specific answers requiring complex DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) measures—a skill area I had underdeveloped compared to my proficiency in SQL.

**The Achievement:** I recognized this technical gap and dedicated immediate, focused effort to rapidly learn and apply advanced DAX concepts. This quick upskilling was essential for modeling the data correctly and delivering precise, measurable answers to the specific business questions.

**4. High-Pressure, Time-Constrained Delivery**

**The Challenge:** I had a strict four-day deadline to complete the analysis and deliver actionable results.

**The Achievement:** Through disciplined time management, I successfully completed 5 out of the 10 complex questions. For each, I delivered a comprehensive report that included a key data-driven insight and a strategic recommendation directly aligned with the company’s objective.

# Conclusion: Measured Growth and Future Focus

This project was a definitive success. I not only delivered quality analysis under pressure but also achieved my personal goal of identifying a critical skill gap in DAX. I transformed that weakness into a focused development area and significantly improved my proficiency in a short timeframe.

I am now committed to further elevating my skills in advanced analytics and DAX to ensure this becomes a core strength.
